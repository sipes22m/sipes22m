<p>My name is Maria Sipes. <b>This is my first HTML lab.</b> I have never coded before, but I'm super excited to get started! I will tell you about myself through the magic of HTML.</p>
<p>I'm a student at <font color=blue>Mount Holyoke College.</font> I'm studying art history with a Nexus in museums, archives, and public history. I also have a radio show through WMHC!</p>
<p>I am from <font color=tomato>Ohio.</font> In <font color=blue>high school</font>, I did theater and choir. I was involved in the performing arts for seven years! </p>
<p>My hometown and South Hadley are very similar. They are both very small with tight-knit communities. However, the university closest to my hometown is <font color="tomato">Ohio State University</font>, which is almost <b>twenty times larger</b> than MHC! </p>
<p>It's nice to get away from the big city I live next to, even if it's only for part of the year.</p>
